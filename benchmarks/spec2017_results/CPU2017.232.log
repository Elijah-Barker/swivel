Notice: Unusable path detected in build directory list file at
        /home/ucsd/SpectreSandboxing/spec2017/benchspec/CPU/619.lbm_s/build/list
        The list file references one or more paths which will be
        ignored because they are not subdirectories of the directory
        where the list file resides.  This condition may be a result of
        having moved your SPEC CPU2017 benchmark tree.  If that's what
        happened, and if you don't need the old build directories, you
        can just remove them, along with the list file.  (Usually it's
        safe to delete old build directories, as they are automatically
        re-created when needed.)
