        where the list file resides.  This condition may be a result of
        having moved your SPEC CPU2017 benchmark tree.  If that's what
        happened, and if you don't need the old run directories, you
        can just remove them, along with the list file.  (Usually it's
        safe to delete old run directories, as they are automatically
        re-created when needed.)
