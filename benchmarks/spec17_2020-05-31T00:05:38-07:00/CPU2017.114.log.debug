Debug log for CPU2017.  This file contains very detailed debugging
output from the CPU2017 tools (as if "--verbose 99" had been specified) and is
typically useful only to developers of the CPU2017 toolset.

For a successful run, this debug log will be removed automatically, unless you
specify "--keeptmp" on the command line, or "keeptmp=1" in your config file.

If you file a support request with cpu2017support@spec.org, you may be
asked to submit this file.
