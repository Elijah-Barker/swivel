Locating benchmarks...found 47 benchmarks in 53 benchsets.
Reading config file '/home/rlsahita/spec2017/config/cet-icc.cfg'
WARNING: The preprocessor macro 'cores' was defined on the
         command line but never referenced in the config file.

ERROR: A reportable run was requested; individual benchmark selection is not
       allowed.  The benchmarks needed for SPECspeed2017_int are not all present.
       If you really want to run only selected benchmarks, then add the switch
        '--noreportable' to the command line.
No benchmark suite selected!  Expected one or more of 'fprate', 'fpspeed', 'intrate', 'intspeed' or 'all'.
