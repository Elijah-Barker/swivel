Locating benchmarks...found 47 benchmarks in 53 benchsets.
Reading config file '/home/rlsahita/spec2017/config/cet-icc.cfg'
WARNING: The preprocessor macro 'cores' was defined on the
         command line but never referenced in the config file.

Can't resolve 'perlbench' to a benchmark; too many matches: 500.perlbench_r, 600.perlbench_s

WARNING: Can't parse 'perlbench' into a single benchmark name, benchset name,
	or metric name.
No benchmark suite selected!  Expected one or more of 'fprate', 'fpspeed', 'intrate', 'intspeed' or 'all'.
